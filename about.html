            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p>In this section I'll talk a bit about some of my action items for finding a new place to live in Manhattan.</p>
            <h3>Moving to Manhattan Action Items</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Find Neighborhoods of Interest</li>
                <li>Determine Budget</li>
                <li>Find Roommates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Find Neighborhoods of Interest: I have actually already completed this step! Something that is super important for moving to a new city, is determining areas in which I might enjoy living. During spring break I visited and toured some Manhattan neighborhoods and got a better idea of places that I liked and didn't like. Some of my favorite areas so far are: East Village, Lower East Side, and NoLita.</p>
            <p>Determine Budget: I am currently working on this step. It is super important to determine how much money I have for spending, what my cost of living in NYC will be, and how much money I have left to spend on rent. I am accomplishing this by capturing my current monthly spending, determining which costs of living will be different next year, adjusting to what my new disposable income will be, and finally determining an appropriate rent range. With this range I can now safely search for apartments knowing what is obtainable.</p>
            <p>Find Roommates: I have not completed this. This is a super important step because most studio or 1-bedroom apartments are not affordable. I would like to prioritize living with people I know personally, but I can also find roommates from the incoming class of associates at PwC or through Facebook roommate groups.</p>
