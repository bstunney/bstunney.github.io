            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a fourth year student at Northeastern University graduating this May with a B.S. in data science and a minor in computational social science. I am originally from Chicago, Illinois, and now I love the east coast -- I love it so much that I'll be moving to NYC this summer after graduation! I'll be joining PwC as a Data Risk & Privacy Associate in the Cybersecurity & Regulation practice. </p>
            <p>I am super excited to move to a new city and to be able to practice data science in industry. I recently visited Manhattan for spring break to tour the various neighborhoods and get a grasp for areas in which I might like to live. My favorites so far are East Village, Lower East Side, and NoLita. I want to prioritize living within a 25 minute commute of my job, affordable rent, access to parks, a young professional environment, and an exciting night life. </p>
            <p>One thing that I am particularly excited for is access to luxury gyms in New York City. After spending four years at Northeastern's Marino Recreation Center, I've grown tired of long lines for squat racks and dirty locker rooms. I love fitness and I am excited to be able to spend money on something that I spend so much of my life doing.</p>
